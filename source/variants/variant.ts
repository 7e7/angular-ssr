  // A transition can be one of two things: either an Injectable class or a function that accepts
  // a dependency injection container.
  //
  // 1. An @Injectable() class which will be instantiated with all of its dependencies resolved,
  // and will then be used to transition the state of the target application in some specific
  // way. This class can take any number of constructor arguments which will be resolved in
  // the context of the executing application, in the context of the app injector. This means
  // that you can request any entity that has been registered with your application's dependency
  // injector system. The class must then take those service instances and and transition the
  // application into the state described by this variant. For example, if this variant is used
  // to change locale settings, then the purpose of this transition would be to select a new
  // locale in the running application. The specific language to select would be provided as an
  // argument to StateTransitionContract<T>::execute. Note that this variant will be combined
  // with all permutations of all other variants, so it should be kept simple and understandable.
  // Avoid doing anything other than setting the specific state described by this variant. Your
  // transition handler should be one or two lines of code. If you are using @ngrx this class
  // should really just dispatch an action or two, for example.
  //
  // 2.
  // A simple function that takes as its argument an NgModuleRef<M> and a variant
  // value and performs the transition itself. It may request values from the dependency
  // injector manually, using {@link NgModuleRef.injector}. This is an alternative to
  // using the useClass construct.
