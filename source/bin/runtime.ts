// Some history is required for this piece of code. Prior to Angular 4, the core team shipped
// multiple versions of each library, two of which we used: the umd bundle and the JavaScript
// compilation output (target es2015), in the src directories. This was problematic because we
// were always forced to use the files from src and never the umd bundles, because NgFactory
// files always contained imports into deep Angular source. Without forcing the use of src always,
// we would get multiple definitions of the same DI tokens, which would result invariably in
// a failure to bootstrap the application. So we forced the app to always import from src and
// never use umd bundles. The story was the same for @angular/material.
//
// But now with Angular 4, everything is shipped in bundles, the src folder is empty, and the
// generated NgFactory files import from those same bundles. So we no longer need to jump through
// hoops just to include Angular code: we can always load from the bundles, which are always
// referenced in the package.json main entry. Generated NgFactory files will do the same.
//
// Unfortunately, it appears that many other projects have not yet caught up to this way
// of doing things. So we must transpile those sources from es2015 to something that can run
// on modern nodejs. We also have our own custom import -> CommonJS plugin because the default
// one that comes in the es2015 preset does not allow you to export the same symbol from the
// same file twice (which @angular/material currently does in several barrel index.ts files).
//
// Libraries that are known to ship in NodeJS compatible formats are whitelisted. And it is
// worth pointing out that this transpilation stuff is for ng-render only (for applications
// using the API, they get to use their own webpack / transpilation process).

// they need transpilation, so we just assume they all do.
