To clean up the transpilation pipeline to solve the Angular bundle vs source duplicate import issue (which right now is solved hackily by search and replace):
- Transform the JS code from importing code to receiving symbols through function arguments
- Look these symbols up from the Identifiers map in the Angular compiler source
- Each of them has a `runtime' property which points to an in-memory representation of the Identifiers
- Transpile our JS output to replace all import statements to use of the `runtime' values from above
- They should receive these values through `new Function` arguments instead of importing themselves

Write TypeScript refactoring tool to transform TypeScript code inplace:
- Use this to help resolve issues related to deep linking by transforming all ngfactory.ts files
  before they go through the second step of the two-step compilation process.

For now, just use Babel to transform the imports to require statements
