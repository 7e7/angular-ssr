# Introduction

The purpose of this library is to allow your application to support server-side rendering of your Angular 4+ applications with minimal code changes and mimimal difficulty. It supports both Angular CLI projects and projects that use custom webpack configurations. It works out of the box with `@angular/material` with no hot-fixes or workarounds! It also requires **zero** changes to your application code: you won't have to create separate `@NgModule`s, one for the server-side rendered application and one for the regular client application. You can just take your Angular code as-is and follow the steps below to get server-side rendering working.

There are two ways you can use `angular-ssr`:
1. If your application is an Angular CLI application with no custom webpack configuration, you can simply install it as a dependency, run a normal `ng build`, and then invoke `ng-render` from `node_modules/.bin`. This will result in several steps being taken:
	* It will use `tsconfig.json` and some other configuration elements to compile your application to a temporary directory and load the resulting JavaScript code (application code + `.ngfactory.js` files) into memory.
	* It will query your router configuration and collect all your application routes into a flattened array (eg. `/`, `/foo`, `/bar`)
	* For each of the discovered routes, it will instantiate your application and render that route to a static `.html` file in `dist` (or, if you specified an alternate output directory using `--output`, it will write the files there). It instantiates the application using the existing `dist/index.html` file that was produced as part of your normal application build as a template. The pre-rendered content will be inserted into that template and written out as a new `.html` file based on the route: e.g., `/foo/index.html`.
2. If your application has custom webpack configurations and loaders, you probably will not be able to use `ng-render`. But that's alright. It just means that you will have to build a separate webpack program output: either a NodeJS HTTP server, or a NodeJS application whose sole purpose is to do prerendering. You will follow these rough steps:
	* Install `angular-ssr` as a dependency: `npm install angular-ssr --save`
	* If you already have multiple webpack configs (one for server and one for client), then you can skip down to the next section and begin writing code to interface with `angular-ssr`.
	* Otherwise, you will need to add an additional output to your existing webpack configurations. This can take two forms: either you modify your existing `webpack.config.js` and just add an additional output, or you create an entirely new `webpack-server.config.js` which will serve as your SSR webpack configuration. Regardless of how you accomplish it, you will ultimately need to produce two programs from webpack:
		* Your normal client-side JavaScript application
		* An additional server-side application that you will use to do server-side rendering. You have a couple choices here, as well:
			* If you want your application to use a NodeJS application with an HTTP server inside of it that will do on-demand pre-rendering of your application routes, then do that. We can then write a few lines of code to do the actual pre-rendering / caching inside of your route handlers. It doesn't matter if you use koa or express or any other HTTP server you wish to use -- 	`angular-ssr` will not integrate directly with the HTTP server anyway. It just exposes a very simple API to get pre-rendered HTML documents, and you can integrate this with your server in whichever way makes the most sense for your application.
			* Alternatively, you can build an application whose sole purpose is to do server-side rendering at build-time. This application will produce some static pre-rendered application content and then exit. This use-case makes sense if your application will not need to do *on-demand* server-side rendering. Let's say for example you just have an application with a few routes (`/a`, `/b`, `/c`, etc.). In this case, since all routes are known in advance and none of them take any URL parameters, we can just pre-render each route at build time and spit out some `.html` files.
			* Let's say that your application **does** need on-demand rendering, though. For example, you are writing a blog application that has URLs like `/blog/post/1`, `/blog/user/3`, etc. In this case, you will need to do on-demand server-side rendering. No problem! In this use-case, it makes sense to build a small HTTP server using express or koa and to write a few lines of code to integrate with `angular-ssr`. Then from inside your server, you can demand render and cache particular routes with arguments like `/blog/post/1`. I will show you some examples of how to do this below.

# The simplest possible case: an Angular CLI application with no built-in HTTP server and no need for on-demand rendering

If your application was generated by `ng new` and does not use any custom webpack configuration, then you will be able to use the `ng-render` CLI tooll to automatically pre-render your application routes into static `.html` files. It is worth emphasizing that this use case is the easiest, but also the least flexible. If you need on-demand rendering, or if you have custom webpack configurations, then you should skip down to the examples below as they will cover your use-case better than this section.

But, in the event that you do have a simple `ng cli` application, you can give `angular-ssr` a whirl just by doing:

```sh
npm install angular-ssr --save
ng build
./node_modules/.bin/ng-render
```

It should spit out some messages like:

```
[info] Writing rendered route / to /Users/bond/proj/dist/index.html
[info] Writing rendered route /foo to /Users/bond/proj/dist/foo/index.html
[info] Writing rendered route /bar to /Users/bond/proj/dist/bar/index.html
```

You can then do `cd dist` and run:

```sh
npm install -g http-server
http-server .
```

Then when you load the application by hitting `http://localhost:8080`, you should see the pre-rendered document in the initial HTTP response (for each route in your application).

# Use cases

## On-demand server-side rendering and caching

Let's get this use-case out of the way first, because I think it is likely to be the most common usage of `angular-ssr`.

You have an HTTP server application that you build as part of your application using webpack. Your HTTP server is written in TypeScript. (If your HTTP server is written in JavaScript, the library will still work in the same way, but you won't be able to copy-paste the code below.)

When you build your application, you are outputting two targets: your actual Angular client application, and your HTTP server application. We are going to focus on the server application here because there will be zero changes to your application code.

Your actual HTTP server code will look something like the following:

```typescript
import 'reflect-metadata';

import {
  ApplicationFromModule,
  DocumentStore,
  fileFromString,
  routeToPath,
} from 'angular-ssr';

import {join} from 'path';

import {AppModule} from '../src/app/app.module';

const dist = join(process.cwd(), 'dist');

const templateDocument = fileFromString(join(dist, 'index.html'));

if (templateDocument.exists() === false) {
  throw new Error('dist/index.html must exist because it is used as an SSR template');
}

const application = new ApplicationFromModule(AppModule);

application.templateDocument(templateDocument.content());

// Pre-render all routes that do not take parameters (angular-ssr will discover automatically)
const prerender = async () => {
  const snapshots = await application.prerender();

  return snapshots.subscribe(
    snapshot => {
      app.get(snapshot.uri, (req, res) => res.send(snapshot.renderedDocument));
    })
    .toPromise();
};

prerender();

const documentStore = new DocumentStore(application);

// Demand render and cache all other routes (eg /blog/post/12)
app.get('*',
  async (req, res) => {
    try {
      const snapshot = await documentStore.load(req.url);

      res.send(snapshot.renderedDocument);
    }
    catch (exception) {
      res.send(templateDocument.content()); // fall back on client-side rendering
    }
  });
```

## Single-use server-side rendering as part of a build process

If your application does not fall into the categories described above (i.e., you do not need on-demand server-side rendering of all URLs), then perhaps your application falls into another category: single-use server-side rendering as part of the application build process.

In this case, your code will look similar to the HTTP server code above, but instead of integrating with express, you will simply use `ApplicationRenderer` to pre-render all application routes and write them to static `.html` files, which you can then serve with the HTTP server of your choosing. Again: this case only makes sense if you do not need on-demand rendering of all application routes.

In this case, your code will look something like this:

```typescript
import 'reflect-metadata';

import {
  ApplicationFromModule,
  ApplicationRenderer,
  HtmlOutput,
  fileFromString,
  pathFromString
} from 'angular-ssr';

import {join} from 'path';

import {AppModule} from '../src/app.module';

const dist = join(process.cwd(), 'dist');

const templateDocument = fileFromString(join(dist, 'index.html'));
if (templateDocument.exists() === false) {
  throw new Error('Build output dist/index.html must exist prior to prerender');
}

const application = new ApplicationFromModule(ServerModule);

application.templateDocument(templateDocument.content());

const html = new HtmlOutput(pathFromString(dist));

const renderer = new ApplicationRenderer(application);

renderer.renderTo(html)
  .catch(exception => {
    console.error('Failed to render due to uncaught exception', exception);
  });
```

## Variants

Now we arrive at the most complex use case. Here we wish to do prerendering and demand rendering inside a NodeJS HTTP server, but we also wish to render variants of each page. For example, our application may support multiple languages. `angular-ssr` supports this using a concept called a _variant_. A variant is essentially a key, a set of unique values, and a _transition function_ which can place the application in the specified state.

### Client code

To illustrate, let's again use the example of locales / languages. Your application has multiple languages and you want to support server-side rendering for each of them. The first time someone loads your application, we set the current language selection to the value of `navigator.language` (eg, "en-US"). We set an application cookie using `document.cookie` so that subsequent loads of the application will include as part of the request the language that the user wishes to view the application in. Assume we have some simple code like this somewhere in the application:

```typescript
import {Component, Injectable, OnInit} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app',
  template: `<locale-selector [value]="localeService.locale" (select)="onLocaleChanged($event)"></locale-selector>`
})
export class LocaleSelector implements OnInit {
  constructor(public localeService: LocaleService) {}

  onLocaleChanged(locale: string) {
    this.localeService.locale = locale;
  }
}

@Injectable()
export class LocaleService {
  get locale(): string {
    return this.extractFromCookie('locale') || (() => {
      this.setInCookie('locale', navigator.language);
      return navigator.language;
    });
  }

  set locale(locale: string) {
    this.setInCookie('locale', locale);
  }

  private getCookies(): Map<string, string> {
    return new Map<string, string>(document.cookie.split(/; /g).map(c => c.split(/=/)));
  }

  private extractFromCookie(key: string): string {
    return this.getCookies().get(key);
  }

  private setInCookie(key: string, value: string) {
    const cookies = this.getCookies();
    cookies.set(key, value);

    document.cookie = Array.from(cookies.entries()).map(([k, v]) => `${k}=${v}`).join('; ');
  }
}
```

Essentially what this code is doing is setting a cookie in two events:
1. The user loads the application for the first time and there is no cookie, so we set the cookie value to `navigator.language`, to respect their system locale settings.
2. If the user changes the locale, we update `document.cookie` with the new `locale` setting.

### Server code

The code above means that our HTTP requests will match one of two cases:
1. The first time the user loads the application, no cookie will be set, in which case we can default to returning the English variant of the server-side rendered app and wait until we have access to `navigator.language` to select the system-correct locale
2. All subsequent requests will have a `locale` cookie which we can use to determine which language we should return when we are querying our document store.

We can handle this by rendering different _variants_ of our application. Let's assume that our application supports `en-US`, `en-CA` and `fr-FR` locales. This is how we would configure the server:

```typescript
import {Injector, Injectable} from '@angular/core';

@Injectable()
export class LocaleTransition {
  constructor(private localeService: LocaleService) {}

  // This is the bit of code that actually executes the transition to set the locale
  // to whichever value is being rendered (but value is guaranteed to be one of the
  // values from the Set we created when we first described the locale variant below).
  // Note that this class can use the ng dependency injection system to retrieve any
  // services that it needs in order to execute the state transition.
  execute(value: string) {
    this.localeService.locale = value;
  }
}

const application = new ApplicationFromModule(AppModule);

application.templateDocument(templateDocument.content());

application.variants({
  locale: {
    values: new Set<string>([
      'en-CA',
      'en-US',
      'fr-FR'
    ]),
    transition: LocaleTransition
  }
});

type ApplicationVariants = {locale: string};

// DocumentVariantStore is a variant-aware special-case of DocumentStore. When you
// query it, you must provide values for each variant key that we described in the
// call to variants() above. But in this application, there is only one key: locale.
const documentStore = new DocumentVariantStore<ApplicationVariants>(application);

app.get('*', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Remember that we set locale in document.cookie, so all requests after the
    // first-ever application load will have a locale cookie that we can use to
    // decide whether to give the user an English or French pre-rendered page.
    const snapshot = await documentStore.load(req.url, {locale: req.cookies.locale});

    res.send(snapshot.renderedDocument);
  }
  catch (exception) {
    res.send(templateDocument.content()); // fall back on client-side rendering
  }
});
```

Voila! Now whenever the user reloads our application or comes back to it in a few days, we are going to hand them a pre-rendered document that is in the language of their choosing! Simple.

# State transfer from server to client

Many applications may wish to transfer some state from the server to the client as part of application bootstrap. `angular-ssr` makes this easy. Simply tell your `ApplicationBuilder` object about your state reader class or function, and any state returned from it will be made available in a global variable called `bootstrapApplicationState`:

```typescript
const application = new ApplicationFromModule(AppModule);

application.stateReader(ServerStateReader);
```

And your `ServerStateReader` class implementation might look like this:

```typescript
import {Injectable} from '@angular/core';

import {Store} from '@ngrx/store';

import {StateReader} from 'angular-ssr';

@Injectable()
export class ServerStateReader implements StateReader {
  constructor(private store: Store<AppState>) {}

  getState(): Promise<MyState> {
    return this.store.select(s => s.someState).toPromise();
  }
}
```

Note that you can inject any service you wish into your state reader. `angular-ssr` will query the constructor arguments using the ng dependency injector the same way it works in application code. Alternatively, you can supply a function which just accepts a bare `Injector` and you can query the DI yourself:

```
application.stateReader((injector: Injector) => {
  const service = injector.get(MyService);
  return service.getState();
});
```

Both solutions are functionally equivalent.

**Note that your state reader will not be called until your application zone becomes stable**. That is to say, when all macro and microtasks have finished. (For example, if your application has some pending HTTP requests, `angular-ssr` will wait for those to finish before asking your state reader for its state. This ensures that your application has finished initializing itself by the time the state reader is invoked.)

# More details on server-side rendering code

The main contract that you use to define your application in a server context is called [`ApplicationBuilder`](https://github.com/clbond/angular-ssr/blob/master/source/application/builder/builder.ts). It has thorough comments and explains all the ways that you can configure your application when doing server-side rendering.

But `ApplicationBuilder` is an interface. It has three concrete implementations:

* `ApplicationFromModule<V, M>`
  * If your code has access to the root `@NgModule` of your application, then this is probably the `ApplicationBuilder` that you want to use. It takes a module type and a template HTML document (`dist/index.html`) as its constructor arguments.
* `ApplicationFromModuleFactory<V>`
  * If your application code has already been run through `ngc` and produced `.ngfactory.js` files, then you can pass your root `@NgModule`'s NgFactory -- not the module definition itself, but its compilation output -- to `ApplicationFromModuleFactory<V>` and you can skip the template compilation process.
* `ApplicationFromSource<V>`
  * You can use this for projects that use `@angular/cli` if you wish to use inplace compilation to generate an `NgModuleFactory` from raw source code. It's fairly unlikely that you will ever use this class: its main purpose is for the implementation of the `ng-render` command.

Other classes of interest are [`DocumentStore`](https://github.com/clbond/angular-ssr/blob/master/source/store/document-store.ts) and [`DocumentVariantStore`](https://github.com/clbond/angular-ssr/blob/master/source/store/document-variant-store.ts). You can use these in conjunction with `ApplicationBuilder` to maintain and query a cache of rendered pages.

## `Snapshot<V>`

Another interesting one is [`Snapshot`](https://github.com/clbond/angular-ssr/blob/master/source/snapshot/snapshot.ts). This is the data structure you get back from the server-side rendering process. It takes a type argument that represents the variants your application is aware of, or `void` if you are not using variants.

One thing to note about `Snapshot` is that it contains far more information than just the final rendered document. It has:

* `console: Array<ConsoleLog>`
  * This is an array of console logs that your application emitted during bootstrap and during the rendering process. It includes errors, infos, warnings, assertions, and anything else that you can emit via `console`.
* `exceptions: Array<Error>`
  * This is an array containing any uncaught exceptions that were generated during the bootstrap and rendering process. Generally it is possible to get back a snapshot that has an empty document and at least one exception in `exceptions`, so you should usually check this in your retrieval methods to ensure that everything worked properly. You don't want to send a mangled document to the user.
* `renderedDocument: string`
  * This is what you are primarily interested in: the final version of the rendered application HTML. This contains the document you will need to send in your HTTP response.
* `variant: V`
  * If you are using [variants](#variants), this describes the particular set of variants that were used to generate this snapshot.
* `uri: string`
  * This is the URI that was originally given to the renderer when this snapshot was generated.

I am in the process of building out some more complete example applications over the next day or two. In the meantime, if you have questions you want answered, you can email me at `cb@clbond.org` or post an issue in this repository and I would be more than happy to answer!
